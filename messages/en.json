      "1": {
        "answer": "Most customers save 70-90% on their electricity bills. A properly sized solar system can save ₹10,000-₹15,000 per month for an average household. Savings depend on your current electricity consumption, system size, and local electricity rates.",

      "2": {
        "answer": "Residential installations typically take 1-3 days depending on system size and roof complexity. Commercial installations take 3-7 days. Industrial projects may take 1-4 weeks. We handle all permits and paperwork to minimize delays.",
