    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "How much do solar panels cost?",
        "answer": "Solar panel costs vary based on system size and location. In India, residential systems typically cost ₹40,000-₹80,000 per kW before subsidies. A 5kW home system costs around ₹2-4 lakhs after government subsidies.\n\nFactors affecting cost:\n• System size (kW capacity)\n• Panel quality and type\n• Inverter technology\n• Installation complexity\n• Location and local regulations\n\nWe provide free quotes with detailed cost breakdowns."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much can I save with solar energy?",
        "answer": "Solar savings depend on your current electricity bill and system size. Most customers save 70-90% on their monthly electricity bills.\n\nExample savings for a 5kW system:\n• Monthly bill reduction: ₹10,000-₹15,000\n• Annual savings: ₹1.2-1.8 lakhs\n• 25-year savings: ₹30-45 lakhs\n\nPayback period is typically 3-4 years, after which you enjoy free electricity for 20+ years."
      },
      {
        "question": "What government subsidies are available?",
        "answer": "Multiple government incentives make solar more affordable:\n\n• Central Government Subsidy: Up to ₹18,000 per kW (max 3kW)\n• State Subsidies: Additional 10-30% in many states\n• Net Metering: Sell excess power back to grid\n• Accelerated Depreciation: 40% for businesses\n• GST Benefits: 5% GST on solar systems\n• Low-interest loans: 2-6% from various banks\n\nTotal subsidies can reduce costs by 30-50%."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does solar installation take?",
        "answer": "Complete solar installation typically takes 3-8 weeks:\n\n• Site survey and design: 1-2 days\n• Permits and approvals: 7-15 days\n• Equipment procurement: 3-7 days\n• Actual installation: 1-3 days\n• Grid connection and testing: 2-5 days\n• Net metering setup: 7-30 days\n\nWe handle all paperwork and coordinate with electricity boards to ensure smooth installation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between on-grid, off-grid, and hybrid systems?",
        "answer": "Three main types of solar systems:\n\n**On-Grid (Grid-Tied):**\n• Connected to electricity grid\n• No battery backup\n• Sell excess power back\n• Cost: ₹40-60k per kW\n• Best for areas with reliable grid\n\n**Off-Grid (Standalone):**\n• Complete independence from grid\n• Battery backup included\n• Works during power cuts\n• Cost: ₹80-120k per kW\n• Best for remote areas\n\n**Hybrid System:**\n• Grid connection + battery backup\n• Best of both worlds\n• Backup during outages\n• Cost: ₹70-100k per kW\n• Best for urban areas with frequent power cuts"
      },
      {
        "question": "How long do solar panels last and what maintenance is required?",
        "answer": "Solar panels are built to last:\n\n**Lifespan:**\n• Solar panels: 25-30 years\n• Inverters: 10-15 years\n• Batteries (if applicable): 5-10 years\n• Performance guarantee: 80% efficiency after 25 years\n\n**Maintenance:**\n• Monthly: Visual inspection\n• Quarterly: Panel cleaning (more in dusty areas)\n• Annually: Professional system checkup\n• Monitoring: 24/7 via mobile app\n\n**Maintenance costs:** ₹2,000-5,000 annually\n**Cleaning impact:** 15-20% performance loss if not cleaned regularly\n\nWe provide comprehensive maintenance packages and 24/7 monitoring services."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sell excess electricity back to the grid?",
        "answer": "Yes! Through net metering, you can sell excess electricity back to the grid:\n\n**Net Metering Benefits:**\n• Send excess power to grid during the day\n• Draw power from grid at night or cloudy days\n• Net calculation at month-end\n• Get paid for extra units generated\n\n**Process:**\n• Net meter installation\n• Electricity board approval\n• Bi-directional metering\n• Monthly billing adjustments\n\nThis accelerates your return on investment and can even result in negative electricity bills!"
      },
      {
        "question": "Do solar panels work during rain and storms?",
        "answer": "Yes, solar panels are designed to work in all weather conditions:\n\n**Weather Resistance:**\n• Rain: Water-resistant, actually helps with cleaning\n• Storms: Can withstand 200+ kmph wind speeds\n• Hail: Protected by tempered glass\n• Snow: Functional down to -40°C\n• Heat: Performance maintained up to +85°C\n\n**Cloudy Days:**\n• 10-25% power generation continues\n• Grid connection compensates for shortfall\n• Battery backup in hybrid systems\n\n**Warranty:** 25-year warranty covers all weather-related damage."
