        "question": "How much does a solar system cost?",
        "answer": "Solar system costs vary based on size and requirements. Residential systems (1-10kW) typically cost ₹40,000-₹80,000 per kW. A 5kW home system costs ₹2-4 lakhs after government subsidies. We provide free consultations and custom quotes based on your specific needs."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "How much can I save with solar panels?",
        "answer": "Savings depend on your current electricity bill and system size. Most customers save 70-90% on their electricity bills. For example, if your monthly bill is ₹15,000, you could save ₹10,000-₹13,000 per month with a properly sized solar system."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "What government subsidies are available?",
        "answer": "The government offers up to ₹18,000 per kW subsidy (maximum 3kW) for residential solar installations. Many states offer additional incentives. Net metering allows you to sell excess power back to the grid. We help you navigate all available subsidies and paperwork."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "How long does installation take?",
        "answer": "Most residential installations are completed in 1-3 days. The entire process from site survey to grid connection typically takes 3-8 weeks, including permits and approvals. We handle all paperwork and coordinate with utility companies."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "What maintenance is required?",
        "answer": "Solar panels require minimal maintenance. Clean panels 2-4 times per year and schedule annual professional inspections. Most systems come with 25-year warranties and monitoring apps to track performance."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "Do solar panels work during power cuts?",
        "answer": "Standard grid-tied systems shut down during power cuts for safety. However, hybrid systems with battery backup can power essential loads during outages. We can design systems based on your backup power needs."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "What is the lifespan of solar panels?",
        "answer": "Quality solar panels last 25+ years with minimal degradation. Most panels come with 25-year performance warranties guaranteeing 80% efficiency after 25 years. Inverters typically last 10-15 years and may need replacement once during the system's lifetime."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "Is my roof suitable for solar panels?",
        "answer": "Most roofs are suitable for solar installations. We need approximately 100 square feet per kW of solar capacity. Our engineers conduct free site surveys to assess structural integrity, shading, and optimal panel placement for maximum energy generation."
