    "questions": {
      "0": {
        "question": "How much does a solar system cost?",
        "answer": "Solar system costs vary based on size and requirements. Residential systems (1-10kW) typically cost ₹40,000-₹80,000 per kW including installation. Commercial systems offer better rates per kW. We provide free detailed quotes after site assessment."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "How much can I save with solar panels?",
        "answer": "Most customers save 70-90% on their electricity bills. A properly sized solar system can save ₹10,000-₹15,000 per month for an average household. Savings depend on your current electricity consumption, system size, and local electricity rates."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "How long does installation take?",
        "answer": "Residential installations typically take 1-3 days depending on system size and roof complexity. Commercial installations take 3-7 days. Industrial projects may take 1-4 weeks. We handle all permits and paperwork to minimize delays."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "What government subsidies are available?",
        "answer": "The Central Government provides subsidies up to ₹78,000 for residential solar systems up to 10kW. Additional state subsidies may apply. We assist with all subsidy applications and documentation to maximize your benefits."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "What warranty do you provide?",
        "answer": "We provide comprehensive warranties: 25 years on solar panels, 5-10 years on inverters, 10 years on mounting structures, and 5 years on installation workmanship. We also offer extended warranty options."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "Do solar panels work during monsoon/cloudy days?",
        "answer": "Yes, solar panels generate electricity even on cloudy days, though at reduced capacity (10-30% of sunny day output). Grid-connected systems ensure continuous power supply, and excess sunny day production compensates for cloudy periods."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "What maintenance is required?",
        "answer": "Solar panels require minimal maintenance - mainly periodic cleaning and annual inspections. We recommend professional cleaning every 2-3 months in dusty areas. Our maintenance packages include regular cleaning, performance monitoring, and technical support."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "How do I know if my roof is suitable for solar?",
        "answer": "Most roofs are suitable for solar installation. We evaluate factors like roof age, structure, orientation, shading, and available space during our free site survey. We can work with various roof types including concrete, metal, and tile roofs."
